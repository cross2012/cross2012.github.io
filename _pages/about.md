I'm an Assistant Professor at MICS Thrust of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GuangZhou) since 2022.

Before joining HKUST(GZ), I was a staff engineer in Samsung Semiconductor Inc. (SSI), USA. I have received the B.Eng. degree in integrated circuit design and integrated systems from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2017. 
In 2018, I joined SSI and worked on energy-efficient high-speed SerDes transceiver and WiFi/BT combo transceiver. I also received the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS) Pre-doctoral Achievement Award in 2017

My current research area focuses on integrated circuit design from RF to mmWave and THz, analog and mixed signal ICs. 

I'm currently looking for highly-motivated PhD and MPhlil students. Please send your CV (include your ranking, awards and publications) and transcripts to my email zqhuang@hkust-gz.edu.cn if you are interested.

For MPhil candidate, please apply the redbird MPhil program and the application will be reviewed by adimission committtee. Since the scholarship for MPhil student is paid by university, the quota for MPhil student is unlimted in our group.  

The PhD candidate selection is mainly determined by supervisor and I will select PhD candidate mainly based on research proposal and interview. 
To evaluate your writing skill and knowledge about research areas, the research proposal needs to be written like a literature review paper following my guideline. I will send you guideline after I receive your CV.
The interview can be scheduled after I receive your research proposal. The interview will cover all chapters of RF Microelectronics and basic knowledge about circuit analysis, microwave engineering, digital and analog integrated circuit, signal and system. Since the interview topic is broad and detailed, multiple interview may be needed.

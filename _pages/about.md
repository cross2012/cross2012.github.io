I'm an Assistant Professor at MICS Thrust of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GuangZhou) since 2022.

Before joining HKUST(GZ), I was a staff engineer in Samsung Semiconductor Inc. (SSI), USA. I have received the B.Eng. degree in integrated circuit design and integrated systems from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2017. 
In 2018, I joined SSI and worked on energy-efficient high-speed SerDes transceiver and WiFi/BT combo transceiver. I also received the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS) Pre-doctoral Achievement Award in 2017

My current research area focuses on integrated circuit design from RF to mmWave and THz, analog and mixed signal ICs.

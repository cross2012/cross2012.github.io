I received the B.Eng. degree in integrated circuit design and integrated systems from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2017. 
In 2018, I joined Samsung Semiconductor Inc., USA, where I has been working on energy-efficient high-speed SerDes transceiver and WiFi/BT combo transceiver. I also received the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS) Pre-doctoral Achievement Award in 2017

My research area includes integrated circuit design from RF to mmWave and THz, including clock generation and transceiver techniques. 

I will join The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GuangZhou) as Assistant Professor and I'm currently looking for highlly-motivated Mphil and PhD students.
Please send your CV to my email address zhuangah@connect.ust.hk if you are interested.
